## Installation / Usage
To download the latest version have a look at the [releases](https://github.com/jens-maus/dessolver/releases) page of this GitHub project. You can download a proper .jar file from there.

To start DESSolver as a standalone application you need to download the installation archive which you can find in the
[releases](https://github.com/jens-maus/dessolver/releases) section of this Github project. Installation as a standalone application should normally very easy as long as you already have a preinstalled java runtime environment (JRE) on the
operating system you are actually using. If you need to install the java environment first, please refer to http://java.sun.com/j2se/ for any further information.

After downloading the jar file you can execute the java application by either doubleclicking on the jar file or by using `java -jar XXXXX.jar` file on the command-line to start the application. In the repository we have also
provided and included a startup-script for Linux (bash) and Windows (bat) which you should be able to execute. This script
should automatically start the application with all necessary data.
