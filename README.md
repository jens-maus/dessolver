## Starting Application
To start DESSolver as a standalone application you need to download the installation archive which you can find in the
download section of this document. Installation as a standalone application should normally very easy as long as you already
have a preinstalled java runtime environment (JRE) on the operating system you are actually using. If you need to install
the java environment first, please refer to http://java.sun.com/j2se/ for any further information.

After downloading the installation zip archive you can extract the archives content to a directory of your choice. We have
provided and included a startup-script for Linux (bash) and Windows (bat) which you should be able to execute. This script
should automatically start the application with all necessary data.
